# Health-projects
Welcome to the Health Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects focused on the healthcare domain. My goal is to use advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world health problems, improving diagnoses, treatments, and the quality of life for patients.
